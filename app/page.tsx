        Welcome to my corner of the internet! My name is Roy Lee and this is where I dump my
        thoughts and share what I've been working on.

        I'm most interested in software engineering and machine learning, and am still trying to
        find an area to focus on in the vast domain of Computer Science. I currently study CS @ The
        University of British Columbia, where I'm coming off of 1 year of co-op and entering my 4th
        year, w/ 1 more year to go.
      </p>
      <p className="font-inconsolata">
        I'm also looking for an internship for the summer of 2024! Previously, I've worked on
        full-stack software engineering @ SAP.

        Beep-booping aside, I feed my family and friends my newest recipe, run around and hit
        birdies, build keyboards and PCs, and scratch my competitive itch w/ collegiate esports. Ask
        me about any of these!
